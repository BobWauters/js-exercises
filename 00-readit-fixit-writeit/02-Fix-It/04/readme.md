# FIX IT
## EX 04
* Why are we not seeing any tv shows? Look at the error message in the dev tools and solve it.
* There is still something else going wrong. Fix this as well. 

## Answer
(script.js:24 Uncaught ReferenceError: show is not defined) error message, show needs to be defines so change it to tvshows which is defined 
--> change all show elements with tvshows

wrapWithTag did not have a return value so it could not give anything in return.
