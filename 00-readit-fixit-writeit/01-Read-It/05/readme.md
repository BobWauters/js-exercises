* The for-loop is no longer present. 
  What was it replaced with? How does this work?
* What does the function 'parseTitle' do? 
  What parameter do we pass to this function?
* What does the function 'wrapWithTag' do? 
  Why are the parameters placed between brackets?
  
## Answer
* for loop has been replaced by the method forEach
        - movies.forEach(movie => parseTitle(movie));  --> instead of creating a for loop
  that says for each time this happens this will happen. 
  now it says movies (so all variables), foreach meaning for each and every variable under movies
  it'll show the movies and titles .
  
* the parse method parses titles (in this case) into its component parts and describes
their role. 
  - lowerTitle, wrapped
  
* I be
